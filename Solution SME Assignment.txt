Here is the approaches that I have detected in the source code and to resolve these issue, I have written the solution to bug and fix it down as:

Error:

C2238: Unexpected error line no 20

In your case, the line virtual: int vvv; is incorrect because there is no function declaration. So to fix this error, we should either remove the virtual keyword if it's not intended to declare a virtual function, or specify a function after the virtual keyword if it's intended to be a virtual function.

For example, if vvv is supposed to be a virtual function:


class v {
    virtual int vvv() { return 0; }  // Declareing a virtual function
};


Or if virtual is not intended, we can remove it:

class v {
    int vvv;  // No virtual function
};



//Next Error
# Compiler Warning C4430
In this case, the error is likely caused by a missing type specifier in the declaration of m_myClass in PlayerController.h around line 20. To resolve this error, we need to specify the correct type for m_myClass.

Here's an example of how to fix it:


struct CMyClass {
   CUndeclared m_myClass;  // C4430 - Error: missing type specifier
   int m_myClass;         //This line is correctly declared with type int
};

//Next Error
# Compiler Error C2143
To resolve this error, we need to explicitly tell the compiler that PutFuncType is a template. we can do this by using the template keyword before PutFuncType, like so:


class MyClass
{
    template<class Ty, typename PropTy>
    struct PutFuncType : public Ty::template PutFuncType<Ty, PropTy>
    {
    };
};
By adding the template keyword, we are indicating to the compiler that PutFuncType is a template and should be treated as such. This should resolve the C2143 error in this context.


//Next Error
# Compiler Warning C4244

In this step, the warning is generated because a double value (x) is being passed to a function f() that expects an integer argument. This can result in the fractional part of the double value being truncated, leading to a loss of data.

To resolve the C4244 warning in this case, we should either change the function f() to accept a double parameter if it's intended to work with floating-point values, or  we should ensure that the value passed to f() is converted to an integer type without loss of precision if it must operate on integers.

Here is how you can modify the code to resolve the warning:




int f(double x){ return 0; } // Change the parameter type of f() to double
int main() {
   double x = 10.1;
   int i = 10;
   return (f(x)); // No C4244 warning
}
By changing the parameter type of f() to double, we ensure that the function can accept floating-point values without causing a loss of data. Alternatively, we can explicitly cast x to an integer if you intend to work with integer values within f().


//Next Error
# Warning C26495

The line generates warning C26495 because the member variable value isn't initialized when a MyStruct object is created.


struct MyStruct
{
    int value;
    MyStruct() {} // C26495, MyStruct::value is uninitialized
};

So to resolve the issue, we can add in-class initialization to all of the member variables.


struct MyStruct
{
    int value{};  // empty brace initializer sets value to 0
    MyStruct() {} // no warning, MyStruct::value is set via default member initialization
};


//Next Error
